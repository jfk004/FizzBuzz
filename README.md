# FizzBuzz

## What is the project
FizzBuzz is a simple programming task that prints the numbers from 1 to 100(inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, the program prints out Fizz instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5 the program prints out Buzz. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it prints out FizzBuzz
